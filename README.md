# Sudoku-Solving-Visualization
This is an app to visualize (using kivy) the solving process of a sudoku via backtracking.

1) Run from main.py
2) Press Start then solve to visualize solving.
3) Speed of solving and visualization can be controlled from the slider on the top.
4) Max speed tries to in minimum time.
5) Currently a custom Sudoku is not supported. Will be added soon. ;)

REQUIRES KIVY GUI LIBRARY
